to metalearning
what I have done mainly advserail model training
difficulties
what it means to for self attention probing classfier
pull out the self attentions for each place, and apply them after ff layer, then pass 
each of them through a softmax to get tag sequence? maybe?
I will do it after my graduation
I didn't have time to finish building the probing classifier, my current one is just
use the precomputed self attention as freezed, and training the whole thing without re-computing it.

I need to build a baseline to compare my divergence score, that should be easy.
